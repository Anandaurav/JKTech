# JKTech

This project is an intelligent book management system that allows users to add, retrieve, update, and delete books from a PostgreSQL database, generate summaries for books using a Llama3 generative AI model, and provide book recommendations based on user preferences. The system also manages user reviews and generates rating and review summaries for books. It is accessible via a RESTful API and can be deployed on AWS.

## Features

- **Book Management**: Add, retrieve, update, and delete books.
- **Book Summarization**: Generate summaries for books using a Llama3 generative AI model.
- **Recommendations**: Provide book recommendations based on genre and average rating.
- **Review Management**: Manage user reviews and generate rating summaries.
- **RESTful API**: Accessible via a well-defined RESTful API.
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Efficient asynchronous operations for database and AI model interactions.
- **AWS Deployment**: Deployment-ready for AWS infrastructure.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/book_management_system.git
   cd book_management_system
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Database Setup

1. **Set up PostgreSQL database**:
   - Install PostgreSQL if not already installed.
   - Create a new PostgreSQL database.

2. **Update `DATABASE_URL` in `app/config.py`**:
   ```python
   DATABASE_URL = "postgresql+asyncpg://username:password@localhost/dbname"
   ```

3. **Create the database tables**:
   - You can use the `startup` event in `app/main.py` to automatically create tables on startup.

## Running the Application

1. **Start the application**:
   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

2. **Access the API documentation**:
   - Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000/docs` to view the interactive API documentation.

## API Endpoints

- **POST /books**: Add a new book.
- **GET /books**: Retrieve all books.
- **GET /books/{id}**: Retrieve a specific book by its ID.
- **PUT /books/{id}**: Update a book's information by its ID.
- **DELETE /books/{id}**: Delete a book by its ID.
- **POST /books/{id}/reviews**: Add a review for a book.
- **GET /books/{id}/reviews**: Retrieve all reviews for a book.
- **GET /books/{id}/summary**: Get a summary and aggregated rating for a book.
- **GET /recommendations**: Get book recommendations based on user preferences.
- **POST /generate-summary**: Generate a summary for a given book content.

## Testing

1. **Run the tests**:
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

## Deployment

### AWS Deployment

1. **Set up an AWS account** if you don't already have one.

2. **Deploy the application on AWS**:
   - Use services such as EC2, Lambda, or ECS for hosting the application.
   - Host the PostgreSQL database on AWS RDS.
   - Use AWS S3 for storing any model files if necessary.

3. **Set up a CI/CD pipeline** for automatic deployment using services like AWS CodePipeline or GitHub Actions.

### Security

1. **Implement authentication** for the API using OAuth, JWT, or any other suitable method.
2. **Ensure secure communication** with the database and API endpoints using HTTPS.

## Running the Project

1. **Ensure your PostgreSQL database is running** and your `DATABASE_URL` is correctly set in `app/config.py`.

2. **Start the FastAPI application**:
   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

3. **Interact with the API**:
   - Use tools like Postman or curl to interact with the API endpoints.
   - You can also use the interactive API documentation available at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.
